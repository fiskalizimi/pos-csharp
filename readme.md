## Project Overview

This project provides a set of C# classes to interact with a fiscalization system. The key components include:

1. **Models**: This is the models generated by Protobuf
2. **ModelBuilder**: Constructs the Citizen and POS coupons (receipts) using predefined tax groups, items, and payment methods.
3. **Signer**: Signs the receipts using a digital signature created with an ECDSA private key.
4. **Fiskalizimi**: Contains methods for constructing, signing, and sending fiscal coupons to the fiscalization service.

### Key Technologies:
- **Protobuf**: Used for serializing the data models (CitizenCoupon, PosCoupon) to binary.
- **ECDSA**: Elliptic curve algorithm used for digital signatures.
- **HttpClient**: For sending data to the fiscalization service.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before integrating the system, ensure you have the following installed:

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- [Protobuf Compiler](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers)
- A valid [ECDSA private key](#key-generation) for signing the data.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/fiskalizimi-integration.git
   cd fiskalizimi-integration

### Citizen Coupon ###

The ```CitizenCoupon``` represents a simplified receipt that will be the part of QR Code. Below is the example structure created by the ```ModelBuilder``` class:

```
public CitizenCoupon GetCitizenCoupon()
{
    var citizenCoupon = new CitizenCoupon
    {
        BusinessId = 1,
        FiscalId = 1,
        CouponId = 2,
        PosId = 1,
        Type = CouponType.Sale,
        Time = new DateTimeOffset(2024, 10, 1, 15,30, 20, TimeSpan.Zero).ToUnixTimeSeconds(),
        Total = 1820,
        TaxGroups =
        {
            new TaxGroup { TaxRate = "C", TotalForTax = 450, TotalTax = 0 },
            new TaxGroup { TaxRate = "D", TotalForTax = 320, TotalTax = 26 },
            new TaxGroup { TaxRate = "E", TotalForTax = 1850, TotalTax = 189 }
        },
        TotalTax = 215
    };
    
    return citizenCoupon;
}
```

The Citizen Coupon includes:

* **BusinessID** which is NUI of the business (received from ATK)
* **FiscalID** also defined by ATK
* **CouponID** is the unique identifier of the fiscal coupon generated by POS system
* **PosID** is the unique id of the POS. POS is the computer/till that has the POS system installed. Each POS unit must have a unique ID.
* **Type** this is the type of the coupon. It is an enum value and can be ```SALE```, ```RETURN``` or ```CANCEL```
* **Time** the time fiscal coupon is issued. The value is Unix timestamp
* **Total** that represents the total value to be paid by customer
* **TaxGroups** is an array of ```TaxGroup``` objects. Each ```TaxGroup``` object represents the details about tax category 
* **TotalTax** is the amount of the tax in total that customer will have to pay

**NOTE:** These details must match the [POS Coupon](#pos-coupon) details, otherwise the coupon will be market as ```FAILED VERIFICATION``` !


### POS Coupon ###

The PosCoupon includes all details of the POS Coupon that will be printed and given to the customer.

```
public PosCoupon GetPosCoupon()
{
    var posCoupon = new PosCoupon
    {
        BusinessId = 1,
        FiscalId = 1,
        CouponId = 2,
        Location = "Prishtine",
        OperatorId = "Kushtrimi",
        PosId = 1,
        Type = CouponType.Sale,
        Time = new DateTimeOffset(2024, 10, 1, 15,30, 20, TimeSpan.Zero).ToUnixTimeSeconds(),
        Items =
        {
            new CouponItem { Name = "uje rugove", Price = 150, Quantity = 3, Total = 450, TaxRate = "C", Type = "TT" },
            new CouponItem { Name = "sendviq", Price = 300, Quantity = 2, Total = 600, TaxRate = "E", Type = "TT" },
            new CouponItem { Name = "buke", Price = 80, Quantity = 4, Total = 320, TaxRate = "D", Type = "TT" },
            new CouponItem { Name = "machiato e madhe", Price = 150, Quantity = 3, Total = 450, TaxRate = "E", Type = "TT" }
        },
        Payments =
        {
            new Payment { Type = PaymentType.Cash, Amount = 500 },
            new Payment { Type = PaymentType.CreditCard, Amount = 1000 },
            new Payment { Type = PaymentType.Voucher, Amount = 320 }
        },
        Total = 1820,
        TaxGroups =
        {
            new TaxGroup { TaxRate = "C", TotalForTax = 450, TotalTax = 0 },
            new TaxGroup { TaxRate = "D", TotalForTax = 320, TotalTax = 26 },
            new TaxGroup { TaxRate = "E", TotalForTax = 1850, TotalTax = 189 }
        },
        TotalTax = 215,
        TotalNoTax = 1605
    };

    return posCoupon;
}
```

The POS Coupon includes:

* **BusinessID** which is NUI of the business (received from ATK)
* **FiscalID** also defined by ATK
* **CouponID** is the unique identifier of the fiscal coupon generated by POS system
* **Location** is the location/city of the Sale Point
* **OperatorID** is the ID/Name of the operator/server
* **PosID** is the unique id of the POS. POS is the computer/till that has the POS system installed. Each POS unit must have a unique ID.
* **Type** this is the type of the coupon. It is an enum value and can be ```SALE```, ```RETURN``` or ```CANCEL```
* **Time** the time fiscal coupon is issued. The value is Unix timestamp
* **Items** is an array of ```CouponItem``` objects. Each ```CouponItem``` represents an item sold to the customer.
* **Payments** is an array of ```Payment``` that represent the types of the payment methods and the amoun used by customer to pay for the goods. The valid types are: ```Cash```, ```CreditCard```, ```Voucher```, ```Cheque```, ```CryptoCurrency```, and ```Other```. 
* **Total** that represents the total value to be paid by customer
* **TaxGroups** is an array of ```TaxGroup``` objects. Each ```TaxGroup``` object represents the details about tax category
* **TotalTax** is the amount of the tax in total that customer will have to pay
* **TotalNoTax** is the total amount without tax that customer will have to pay

**NOTE:** These details must match the [Citizen Coupon](#citizen-coupon) details, otherwise the coupon will be market as ```FAILED VERIFICATION``` !

## Key Generation ##

There are different ways to generate a PKI key pair, depending on the operating system. 

**WARNING!** Each POS system (PC/till) needs to have its own PKI key pair. The private key should never leave the machine that it is generated on !!!

We have provided a tool that simplifies the process a lot by creating the key pair, generating a CSR and sending the CSR to ATK Certificate Authority to be digitally signed and verified. 

To download the tool on you machine, click on one of the links below (depending on the operating system you are using):

* [atkcli for windows](https://github.com/fiskalizimi/pos-csharp/raw/refs/heads/main/atkcli/atk-cli-windows.zip)
* [atkcli for MacOS Intel](https://github.com/fiskalizimi/pos-csharp/raw/refs/heads/main/atkcli/atk-cli-macos-intel.zip)
* [atkcli for MacOS M1/M2](https://github.com/fiskalizimi/pos-csharp/raw/refs/heads/main/atkcli/atk-cli-macos-apple-silicon.zip)
* [atkcli for Linux](https://github.com/fiskalizimi/pos-csharp/raw/refs/heads/main/atkcli/atk-linux.zip)

Once you have downloaded the atkcli tool, and extracted/unzipped it to a folder, then you need to use the following command by chaning the values in curly braces and providing valid data:

```
./atkcli onboard -b "{businesID}" -f "{fiscalID}" -p "{PosID} -n "{Business name}" -u "http://a94422f45ed154fe59456dd9678d460f-556849162.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/ca/signcsr"
```

For example, if you BusinssID (NUI) is 888234, FiscalID is 3543234 and the business name is "Joe Bloggs Caffee", then the command for POS with id 1 would look like:
```
 ./atkcli onboard -b "888234" -f "3543234" -p "1"  -n "Joe Bloggs Caffee" -u "http://a94422f45ed154fe59456dd9678d460f-556849162.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/ca/signcsr"
```

if everything went Ok, you should get back a 200 response and a valid certificate, something like:

```

```
and in the folder you will have another three files:

* ```privatekey.bin``` - the private key generated by atkcli (encrypted)
* ```csr.pem``` - CSR (Certificate Signing Request) generated by atkcli and sent to CA
* ```certificate.bin``` - signed certificate by ATC CA (encrypted)

To view certificate and private key in PEM format, using the command below:

```
./atkcli cert show -p
```

To extract certificate and private key in PEM format, using the command below:
```
./atkcli cert export -p
```

the last command will create another two files in the folder ```private-key.pem``` and ```signed-certificate.pem```

**WARNING !** Makes sure to keep private key safe.

## Digital Signing ##

Before the data is sent to the Fiscalization System, the POS Coupon details need to be digitally signed using the private key to ensure the authenticity and integrity of the data transmitted to the fiscalization system.

#### Why Digital Signing? ####

The fiscalization system requires each coupon to be signed digitally before submission to ensure:

1. **Data Integrity:** Ensures that the data sent to the fiscalization service has not been tampered with during transmission.
3. **Authentication:** Confirms that the coupon is issued by a legitimate entity (in this case, your business), preventing fraudulent submissions.
3. **Non-Repudiation:** Guarantees that the sender cannot deny sending the data once it has been signed and submitted.

The digital signature is generated using a private key, and the fiscalization service verifies the signature using a corresponding public key. If the signature is valid, the coupon is considered authentic.

The steps that are needed to provide a valid signature are:

1. **Serialization:** First, the coupon (either a Citizen or POS coupon) is serialized into a Protobuf binary format. This format ensures that the data can be transmitted efficiently and consistently.
   ```
   byte[] posCouponProto = posCoupon.ToByteArray();
   ```
2. **Base64 Encoding:** The serialized Protobuf binary data is then encoded into a Base64 string. Base64 is a binary-to-text encoding scheme that makes it easy to transfer data as a string format.
   ```
   var base64EncodedProto = Convert.ToBase64String(posCouponProto);
   ```
3. **Hashing:** Before signing, the data is hashed using a SHA-256 cryptographic hash function. Hashing converts the coupon data into a fixed-length string of bytes, ensuring that even a small change in the original data will produce a completely different hash value.
   ```
   var sha256 = SHA256.Create();
   var hash = sha256.ComputeHash(base64EncodedProto);
   ```
4. **Signature Creation:** The hash is then signed using the ECDSA private key. This generates a digital signature, which is unique to the data and the private key. The fiscalization system can later verify this signature using the corresponding public key.
   ```
   var ecdsa = ECDsa.Create();
   ecdsa.ImportFromPem(_key);  // Load the private key
   var signature = ecdsa.SignHash(hash);
   ```
5. **Base64 Signature:** The generated signature is then encoded into a Base64 string, which makes it easy to include in the final request to the fiscalization service.
   ```
   var encodedSignature = Convert.ToBase64String(signature);
   ```

The Signer class digitally signs both Citizen and POS coupons using the **ECDSA** algorithm. A private key is loaded and used to create a signature over the serialized coupon data.

```
public string SignBytes(byte[] data)
{
    var ecdsa = ECDsa.Create();
    ecdsa.ImportFromPem(_key);
    var hash = SHA256.Create().ComputeHash(data);
    var signature = ecdsa.SignHash(hash);
    return Convert.ToBase64String(signature);
}
```

The return value is a **base64-encoded** signature.
