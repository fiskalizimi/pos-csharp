# Fiscalization Integration with C# using Protobuf

This repository provides a C# implementation for integrating with a fiscalization system using classes generated by Protobuf. The process includes constructing fiscal receipts (Citizen and POS Coupons), digitally signing them, and submitting them to the fiscalization service. This guide walks you through the steps necessary to integrate and execute the solution.

## Project Overview

This project provides a set of C# classes to interact with a fiscalization system. The key components include:
1. **ModelBuilder**: Constructs the Citizen and POS coupons (receipts) using predefined tax groups, items, and payment methods.
2. **Signer**: Signs the receipts using a digital signature created with an ECDSA private key.
3. **Fiskalizimi**: Contains methods for constructing, signing, and sending fiscal coupons to the fiscalization service.

### Key Technologies:
- **Protobuf**: Used for serializing the data models (CitizenCoupon, PosCoupon) to binary.
- **ECDSA**: Elliptic curve algorithm used for digital signatures.
- **HttpClient**: For sending data to the fiscalization service.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before integrating the system, ensure you have the following installed:

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- [Protobuf Compiler](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers)
- A valid [**ECDSA private key**](#key-generation) for signing the data.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/fiskalizimi-integration.git
   cd fiskalizimi-integration

## Model Explanation ##

### Citizen Coupon ###

The ```CitizenCoupon``` represents a simplified receipt that will be the part of QR Code. Below is the example structure created by the ```ModelBuilder``` class:

```cgo
public CitizenCoupon GetCitizenCoupon()
{
    var citizenCoupon = new CitizenCoupon
    {
        BusinessId = 1,
        FiscalId = 1,
        CouponId = 2,
        PosId = 1,
        Type = CouponType.Sale,
        Time = new DateTimeOffset(2024, 10, 1, 15,30, 20, TimeSpan.Zero).ToUnixTimeSeconds(),
        Total = 1820,
        TaxGroups = {
            new TaxGroup { TaxRate = "C", TotalForTax = 450, TotalTax = 0 },
            new TaxGroup { TaxRate = "D", TotalForTax = 320, TotalTax = 26 },
            new TaxGroup { TaxRate = "E", TotalForTax = 1850, TotalTax = 189 }
        },
        TotalTax = 215
    };
    return citizenCoupon;
}
```

The Citizen Coupon includes:

* **BusinessID** which is NUI of the business (received from ATK)
* **FiscalID** also defined by ATK
* **CouponID** is the unique identifier of the fiscal coupon generated by POS system
* **PosID** is the unique id of the POS. POS is the computer/till that has the POS system installed. Each POS unit must have a unique ID.
* **Type** this is the type of the coupon. It is an enum value and can be ```SALE```, ```RETURN``` or ```CANCEL```
* **Time** the time fiscal coupon is issued. The value is Unix timestamp
* **Total** that represents the total value to be paid by customer
* **TaxGroups** is an array of ```TaxGroup``` objects
* **TotalTax** is the amount of the tax in total that customer will have to pay

**NOTE:** These details must match the ```POS Coupon``` details, otherwise the coupon will be market as ```FAILED VERIFICATION``` !
